Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has the sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.


maxcount=None
maxword=None
new=dict()
lst=list()
name = raw_input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox.txt"
handle = open(name)
for line in handle:
	line=line.rstrip()
	if not line.startswith('From'):
		continue
	if line.startswith('From:'):
		continue
	words=line.split()
	lst.append(words[1])
	
for name in lst:
	new[name]=new.get(name , 0) + 1
for word,count in new.items():
	if maxcount is None or count>maxcount:
		maxcount=count
		maxword=word
print maxword,maxcount
